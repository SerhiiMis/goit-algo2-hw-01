# ðŸ“˜ Homework Assignment: Divide and Conquer Algorithms

## âœ… Task 1: Find Minimum and Maximum in an Array

**Goal:**  
Implement a recursive function using the **Divide and Conquer** approach to find the **minimum** and **maximum** elements in an array.

**Requirements:**

- Input: An array of numbers of any length.
- Output: A tuple `(min, max)`.
- Method: Divide and Conquer (recursive approach).
- Time Complexity: **O(n)**.

## ðŸŒŸ Task 2 (Optional): Find the k-th Smallest Element

**Goal:**  
Implement the **Quick Select** algorithm to find the **k-th smallest element** in an unsorted array.

**Requirements:**

- Input: An array of numbers and an integer `k`.
- Output: The k-th smallest element (1-based index).
- Method: Use a pivot element, as in QuickSort, but **do not sort the whole array**.
- Expected Average Time Complexity: **O(n)**.
- Note: This is a Divide and Conquer algorithm where the "Combine" step is trivial.
